                    <p>
                        Dr. G.S. Matharoo, Chairman, Prudence Group of Schools has a great passion for providing the
                        right education system especially for the school going students. There was a deep sense of
                        disquiet about several aspects of our educational system, particularly the school system, which
                        he sincerely wished to set it right. His ardent desire drove him to voluntarily retire from his
                        successful career in the Indian Civil Service when it was at its peak, and take upon himself the
                        responsibility to set up schools on the lines of his principles and beliefs. He was so enamoured
                        with the inclination to serve the nation with his contribution towards facilitating a good
                        education system, that nothing could thwart him from starting a new chain of school by the name
                        of Prudence. Witiy his unparalleled commitment to the cause of education and a dream for a truly
                        educated and self-sufficient nation, he started reforming and practising in his schools, those
                        essential areas that needed urgent attention. He has been pioneering far reaching transformation
                        in the field of School Education through his dynamic and visionary leadership.<br>

                        Dr Matharoo's ways are very refreshing as he relates from real life situations sharing instances
                        from his own life and leading by examples. He dwells on the overall development of the students
                        and emphasizes on personalized attention to be given to each student. He inspires his school
                        heads and team members to focus on the present grooming and nurturing of the students so that
                        their future is taken care of. For more than a decade now, he has successfully delivered amongst
                        others attainment based learning: personal learning plans; performance-based learning: advanced
                        technologies as tools; and teachers asÂ facilitators.
